    title: "Best of 2024",
    description:
      "I spent the last year glued to my console, trying to keep up with every big release. Some nights I almost forgot to eat because I was so absorbed in these worlds. I wanted to make a list of the games that genuinely blew me away, whether through stunning graphics, clever mechanics, or unforgettable stories. Some of these games had me screaming at the screen, others had me crying in my blanket. I even convinced my roommate to play a few, and now they refuse to talk to me unless I include certain titles. This is the ultimate collection of 2024 must-plays, the ones I’ll remember when I look back on this year. It’s a mix of fun, emotion, and a little obsession, just like my gaming life!",

      "I have an irrational fear of basements, closets, and really anything dark, yet here I am making a list of the scariest games ever. Every night, I light three candles and keep a flashlight nearby just in case. Some of these games made me scream so loud my cat hid under the bed. I wanted a list that truly captures the terror and thrills I felt, from tense psychological horrors to straight-up jump-scare nightmares. I even dared to try them alone, which I do not recommend. Making this list was both terrifying and hilarious, especially when I accidentally flinched at my own shadow. If you love screaming at your screen, this collection will be perfect for you!",

      "I have a weakness for tight controls, interconnected worlds, and epic boss fights, so Metroidvanias have always been my jam. I remember staying up until 3 a.m. just to finish a secret area or discover a hidden ability. Making this list was a trip down memory lane, recalling all the moments that made me gasp, scream, or fist-pump in joy. Some games frustrated me to tears, others delighted me with beauty and music that stuck in my head for weeks. I also argued online about which Metroidvania is the best — this list is my compromise. Every game here is hand-picked based on hours of obsession, exploration, and pure fun. If you want intense platforming with a touch of magic, this is your go-to list!",

I made this list partly as a countdown and partly as a survival guide for my friends who have less patience. These titles promise epic adventures, insane graphics, and stories that might make me cry or laugh until my stomach hurts. Honestly, I can’t wait, and this list is my way of sharing the excitement!",

      "I never thought video games could hit me like a punch in the heart until I played these titles. Some moments had me ugly-crying on the couch, others made me reflect on life or my childhood. I made this list to honor games that evoke real emotion, not just fun or challenge. Friends mocked me for sobbing over pixelated characters, but I don’t care. There’s magic in storytelling, music, and character development that sticks with you. This list is for anyone who believes games can be art. Be prepared: tissues might be required!",

I even created mini challenges for myself to see how far I could push. These games tested reflexes and patience, often in the most fun ways. If you love speed and intensity, this list is for you!",

Some nights I stayed up until dawn plotting my next move, often muttering to myself. I even argued with friends about the best approaches, which was mostly shouting. Each game here challenged my brain and rewarded clever thinking. I sometimes replayed them just to see if I could do better. If you love planning, strategy, and the thrill of victory, you’ll love these titles.",
